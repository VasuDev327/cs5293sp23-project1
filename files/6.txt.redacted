 Saturday night sounds great, ███████ is in South Africa for the next 2 weeks 
so I'm ready. Call me at home ████████████ or at work ████████████.
 Golf also sound good, another guy from Calgary who now works down here █████ 
Dorland, I think you've met ███ before, wants to golf as well. 
 Look forward to seeing you.
